I occasionally conduct research in the broad area of sequential decision-making and, at other times, teach myself, supervise students, manage projects, assist with courses, play chess, and roam the world.  

Brief bio
======
I am fortunate to pursue a PhD at [Delft Center for Systems and Control](https://www.tudelft.nl/me/over/afdelingen/delft-center-for-systems-and-control) under the joint supervision of [Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani](https://mohajerinesfahani.github.io/) and [Sergio Grammatico](https://sites.google.com/site/grammaticosergio/) since 2023. I completed an MS(by Research) degree in electrical engineering from [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), India, under the joint supervision of [Ashish R. Hota](https://facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ahota/index.html) and [Prabodh Bajpai](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~pbajpai/) in 2023. Before that, I did my B.Tech in electrical engineering from [Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College](https://jgec.ac.in/) in 2019. 

Research interests
======
Although I hardly understand how to commit to a meaningful research direction, I found myself attached to the following areas. 
1. Sequential decision-making in static and dynamic environments (e.g., Model predictive control, Multi-armed bandits, Online learning, Reinforcement learning, etc.)
2. Inverse game theory
3. Applications to real-world complex systems like modern power systems, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, etc.
