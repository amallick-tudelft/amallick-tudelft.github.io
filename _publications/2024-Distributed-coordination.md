## Summary

This paper presents a distributed optimization framework using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to coordinate multiple microgrids for provisioning passive voltage support ancillary services to the transmission grid. The approach introduces novel mixed-integer inequalities to model feasible active and reactive power exchanges, leveraging inverter capabilities and storage flexibility to ensure grid support without centralized control.
